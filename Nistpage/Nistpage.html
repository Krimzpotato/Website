		<h1>Banepa Nist college</h1>
		<p>Banepa NIST Secondary School was established in 2012 in Nayabasti-9, Banepa, as an extension of the National School of Sciences in Kathmandu. It has come a long way from its humble beginning with only a few students and teaching staff a decade ago to becoming a premier academic institution in the region. The School is situated in a serene and secluded area on the side of Nala Road, in the north of Banepa, 1.5 kilometers away from the city center. The main objective behind establishing NIST School in Banepa is to provide quality education in the region so that students do not need to travel to the congested, noisy, and relatively expensive capital city.</p>
